# Personal Project Idea

## The idea: King of Tokyo

The application will be a replica of the board
game *King of Tokyo*. It will have an arbitrary
number of player boards each with life, 
energy, victory points, and current
Keep power cards. There will also be a deck with
an arbitrary number of buyable "cards" each
with energy cost and the effect (Note that to 
simplify the project, cards may
be simplified to effects that are easier
to track). There will also be some randomized 
"dice" system for player turns that resolve
to their proper effects. The game-state will be
able to be saved at any point and reloaded. 

## Why this idea?

People who like the board game *King of Tokyo*
might want a digital method to play this game. 
This project is of interest to me because I 
like *King of Tokyo* as a party game with 
friends. 

## Some user stories 
Note: these user stories are essentially parts
of the actual game
- As a user, I want to be able to view my health,
energy, and current victory points as well as 
those of my opponents
- As a user, I want to be able to purchase cards
from an arbitrarily-sized deck and add them to
my arbitrarily-sized collection
- As a user, I want to be able to save the current
game state and reload my game later on

## Stretch Goals
- As a user, I want to be able to "roll" dice
  and have them resolve to their correct effects
  - Includes gaining victory points, dealing
  damage, healing, gaining energy
- As a user, I want to be able to re-roll an
  arbitrary number of dice
- As a user, I want to have a "turn" system that
still allows for out-of-turn effects
- As a user, I want to win when either all other
players are dead or once I reach a certain 
number of victory points
