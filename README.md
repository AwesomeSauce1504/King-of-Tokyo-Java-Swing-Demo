# Personal Project Idea

## The idea: King of Tokyo

The application will be a replica of the board
game *King of Tokyo*. It will have an arbitrary
number of player boards each with life, 
energy, victory points, and current
Keep power cards. There will also be a deck with
an arbitrary number of buyable "cards" each
with energy cost and the effect (Note that to 
simplify the project, cards may
be simplified to effects that are easier
to track). There will also be some randomized 
"dice" system for player turns that resolve
to their proper effects. The game-state will be
able to be saved at any point and reloaded. 

## Why this idea?

People who like the board game *King of Tokyo*
might want a digital method to play this game. 
This project is of interest to me because I 
like *King of Tokyo* as a party game with 
friends. 

## Some user stories 
Note: these user stories are essentially parts
of the actual game
- As a user, I want to be able to "roll" dice
and have them resolve to their correct effects
- As a user, I want to be able to re-roll an
arbitrary number of dice
- As a user, I want to be able to view my health,
energy, and current victory points. 
- As a user, I want to be able to purchase cards
from the deck
